# Urban Expansion Analysis – La Plata (Argentina)

This project analyzes urban expansion in the district of La Plata, Buenos Aires Province, between 2010, 2011, and 2019.

Argentina is a highly urbanized country, with more than 90% of its population living in cities. However, urban expansion has often occurred without adequate planning, resulting in physical growth that, in some contexts, exceeds population growth (Ministry of the Interior, Public Works, and Housing, 2018).

This study evaluates urban growth dynamics using **Indicator 11.3.1** of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 11), which measures the ratio between land consumption rate and population growth rate.

## Project Overview

The objective of this analysis is to assess the relationship between:

- Physical urban expansion  
- Population growth  
- Urban sustainability performance  

Indicator 11.3.1 was calculated for the selected years using official public data and geospatial analysis tools in QGIS.

The study contributes to understanding whether urban growth in La Plata follows patterns aligned with sustainable territorial development.

## Data

- Official public data sources  
- Population data and urban land use information  
- Source: https://portalgeoestadistico.indec.gob.ar/  

Spatial datasets were processed and analyzed using QGIS.

## Methodology

The workflow included:

1. Compilation of official demographic and spatial datasets  
2. Delimitation of urbanized areas for 2010, 2011, and 2019  
3. Calculation of land consumption rate  
4. Calculation of population growth rate  
5. Estimation of SDG Indicator 11.3.1  
6. Cartographic production and spatial visualization

## Tools and Technologies

- QGIS  
- Official public datasets
- Spatial analysis techniques  

---

## Results

The analysis shows considerable urban expansion during the study period.

However, on average, physical urban expansion was lower than population growth, resulting in decreasing index values over time. This suggests a performance aligned with the sustainability objective measured by Indicator 11.3.1.

## Conclusions

Indicator 11.3.1 shows performance consistent with the sustainable development objective evaluated.

However, studies of this type should be complemented with additional monitoring of public service provision and infrastructure access, as these factors directly affect urban quality of life.
