# Urban Expansion Analysis

Argentina is a highly urbanized country, with more than 90% of its population living in cities. However, urban expansion has taken place without planning, resulting in physical expansion that is four times greater than actual population growth (Ministry of the Interior, Public Works, and Housing, 2018). This type of urbanization runs counter to one of the Sustainable Development Goals, SDG 11, which aims to achieve more inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities. This study analyzes the urban expansion of the district of La Plata, in the province of Buenos Aires, between 2010, 2011, and 2019, by calculating Indicator 11.3.1 (Atlas ID, 2015). To this end, data from public agencies and geospatial analysis tools in QGIS were used. 

## Tools and Technologies

- QGIS
- Official public data (https://portalgeoestadistico.indec.gob.ar/)

## Results
Considerable urban expansion can be observed during the period analyzed. However, on average, physical urban expansion is lower than population growth, which is why the index values are decreasing.

## Conclusions

Indicator 11.3.1 shows performance in line with the objective set. However, studies of this type should be reinforced to additionally monitor the provision of public services, which has a direct impact on quality of life.
